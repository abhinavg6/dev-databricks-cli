# MAGIC Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) keeps a database, which tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. In this report, we explore that database and answer what weather events have had most adverse impact on population health and economy over the years.
