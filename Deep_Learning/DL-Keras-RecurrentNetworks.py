# MAGIC ## Networks for Understanding Time-Oriented Patterns in Data
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Common time-based problems include
# MAGIC * Sequence modeling: "What comes next?" 
# MAGIC     * Likely next letter, word, phrase, category, cound, action, value
# MAGIC * Sequence-to-Sequence modeling: "What alternative sequence is a pattern match?" (i.e., similar probability distribution)
# MAGIC     * Machine translation, text-to-speech/speech-to-text, connected handwriting (specific scripts)

# MAGIC %md ### Simplified Approaches
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * If we know all of the sequence states and the probabilities of state transition...
# MAGIC     * ... then we have a simple Markov Chain model.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * If we *don't* know all of the states or probabilities (yet) but can make constraining assumptions and acquire solid information from observing (sampling) them...
# MAGIC     * ... we can use a Hidden Markov Model approach.
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC These approaches have only limited capacity because they are effectively stateless and so have some degree of "extreme retrograde amnesia."
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Can we use a neural network to learn the "next" record in a sequence?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC First approach, using what we already know, might look like
# MAGIC * Clamp input sequence to a vector of neurons in a feed-forward network
# MAGIC * Learn a model on the class of the next input record
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's try it! This can work in come situations, although it's more of a setup for our next development.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md The network does learn, and could be trained to get a good accuracy. But what's really going on here?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's leave aside for a moment the simplistic training data (one fun experiment would be to create corrupted sequences and augment the data with those, forcing the network to pay attention to the whole sequence).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Because the model is fundamentally symmetric and stateless (in terms of the sequence; naturally it has weights), this model would need to learn every sequential feature relative to every single sequence position. That seems difficult, inflexible, and inefficient.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Maybe we could add layers, neurons, and extra connections to mitigate parts of the problem. We could also do things like a 1D convolution to pick up frequencies and some patterns.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC But instead, it might make more sense to explicitly model the sequential nature of the data (a bit like how we explictly modeled the 2D nature of image data with CNNs).

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ## Recurrent Neural Network Concept
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __Let's take the neuron's output from one time (t) and feed it into that same neuron at a later time (t+1), in combination with other relevant inputs. Then we would have a neuron with memory.__
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We can weight the "return" of that value and train the weight -- so the neuron learns how important the previous value is relative to the current one.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Different neurons might learn to "remember" different amounts of prior history.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This concept is called a *Recurrent Neural Network*, originally developed around the 1980s.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Training a Recurrent Neural Network
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="http://i.imgur.com/iPGNMvZ.jpg">
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We can train an RNN using backpropagation with a minor twist: since RNN neurons with different states over time can be "unrolled" (i.e., are analogous) to a sequence of neurons with the "remember" weight linking directly forward from (t) to (t+1), we can backpropagate through time as well as the physical layers of the network.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This is, in fact, called __Backpropagation Through Time__ (BPTT)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The idea is sound but -- since it creates patterns similar to very deep networks -- it suffers from the same challenges:
# MAGIC * Vanishing gradient
# MAGIC * Exploding gradient
# MAGIC * Saturation
# MAGIC * etc.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC i.e., many of the same problems with early deep feed-forward networks having lots of weights.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 10 steps back in time for a single layer is a not as bad as 10 layers (since there are fewer connections and, hence, weights) but it does get expensive.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC "Pure" RNNs were never very successful. Sepp Hochreiter and JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber (1997) made a game-changing contribution with the publication of the Long Short-Term Memory unit. How game changing? It's effectively state of the art today.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <sup>(Credit and much thanks to Chris Olah, http://colah.github.io/about.html, Research Scientist at Google Brain, for publishing the following excellent diagrams!)</sup>

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC An LSTM unit is a set of neurons combines for some bonus features:
# MAGIC * Purely-internal cell state propagated across time
# MAGIC * Input, Output, Forget gates
# MAGIC * Learns retention/discard of cell state, admixture of new data
# MAGIC * Output partly distinct from state
# MAGIC * Use of __addition__ (not multiplication) to combine input and cell state allows state to propagate unimpeded across time (addition of gradient)

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Do LSTMs Work Reasonably Well?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __Yes!__ These architectures are in production (2017) for deep-learning-enabled products at Baidu, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and elsewhere. They are used to solve problems in time series analysis, speech recognition and generation, connected handwriting, grammar, music, and robot control systems.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md __Memory and context__
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC If this network is learning the way we would like, it should be robust to noise and also understand the relative context (in this case, where a prior letter occurs in the sequence).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC I.e., we should be able to give it corrupted sequences, and it should produce reasonably correct predictions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Make the following change to the code to test this out:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * We'll use "W" for our erroneous/corrupted data element
# MAGIC * Add code at the end to predict on the following sequences:
# MAGIC     * 'WBC', 'WKL', 'WTU', 'DWF', 'MWO', 'VWW', 'GHW', 'JKW', 'PQW'
# MAGIC * Notice any pattern? Hard to tell from a small sample, but if you play with it (trying sequences from different places in the alphabet, or different "corruption" letters, you'll notice patterns that give a hint at what the network is learning
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __Pretty cool... BUT__
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This alphabet example does seem a bit like "tennis without the net" since the original goal was to develop networks that could extract patterns from complex, ambiguous content like natural language or music, and we've been playing with a sequence (Roman alphabet) that is 100% deterministic and tiny in size.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC First, go ahead and start `05b-LSTM-Language` since it will take several minutes to produce its first output.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This latter script is taken 100% exactly as-is from the Keras library examples folder (https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_text_generation.py) and uses precisely the logic we just learned, in order to learn and synthesize English language text from a single-author corpuse. The amazing thing is that the text is learned and generated one letter at a time, just like we did with the alphabet.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Compared to our earlier examples...
# MAGIC * there is a minor difference in the way the inputs are encoded, using 1-hot vectors
# MAGIC * and there is a *significant* difference in the way the outputs (predictions) are generated: instead of taking just the most likely output class (character) via argmax as we did before, this time we are treating the output as a distribution and sampling from the distribution.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Let's take a look at the code ... but even so, this will probably be something to come back to after lunch or a break, as the training takes about 5 minutes per epoch (late 2013 MBP CPU) and we need around 20 epochs (80 minutes!) to get good output.

It is recommended to run this script on GPU, as recurrent
networks are quite computationally intensive.
